# 2048-The Game of Intellectuals.
A submit of minor project to Codex(S'o'A University).
 # Overview:
   - 2048 is a single-player sliding block puzzle game. The game's objective is to slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them to create     a tile with the number 2048. However, one can continue to play the game after reaching the goal, creating tiles with larger numbers.
# Rules:  
   - 2048 is played on a gray 4Ã—4 grid, with numbered tiles that slide smoothly when a player moves them using the four arrow keys.
   - Every turn, a new tile will randomly appear in an empty spot on the board with a value of either 2 or 4.
   - Tiles slide as far as possible in the chosen direction until they are stopped by either another tile or the edge of the grid. If two tiles of the same number collide while moving, they will merge into a tile with the total value of the two tiles that collided.
   - If a move causes three consecutive tiles of the same value to slide together, only the two tiles farthest along the direction of motion will combine.
   - If all four spaces in a row or column are filled with tiles of the same value, a move parallel to that row/column will combine the first two and last two.
   - A scoreboard on the upper-right keeps track of the user's score. The user's score starts at zero, and is increased.
   - The game is won when a tile with a value of 2048 appears on the board, hence the name of the game. After reaching the 2048 tile, players can continue to play (beyond the 2048 tile) to reach higher scores.
   - Once the board is full with no possible movement,user couldn't have any further proceedings.
